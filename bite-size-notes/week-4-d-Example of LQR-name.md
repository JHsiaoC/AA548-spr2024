# Objectives: 
1. Review the LQR 
2. Walkthough a example of invertid pendulem 
# Introduction: 
LQR is the a optimal solution of a full state feedback control to minimine the control efforts. Let break down this sentence and to understand what does this tell us ? 
## What is a fullstate feedback control.
A standar full feedback controle has the block diagram.

A classic fullstate feecback controller regulates the system to all 0 states, (There are deviation out of the scope) 
##what is pole placement ?
The open loop of the state space system is:
$$ \dot{x} $$
##How to chose K ?
