# Successive Convexification (SCvx) and Guaranteed Sequential Trajectory Optimization (GuSTO) SCP Algorithms

## SCOPE
This note is all about two specific Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) algorithms; Successive Convexification (SCvx) and Guaranteed Sequential
Trajectory Optimization (GuSTO). We will briefly introduce SCP before diving into the two algorithms discussing what 
they are used for and how to use them. This is a simplified version of a paper written by researchers from the University of 
Washington's Autonomous Controls Laboratory (UW ACL), the developers of the two algorithms[1].

## Motivation
Generating safe and reliable trajectories is crucial in the autonomous world. This challenges engineers and researchers to develop algorithms that
that focuses on safety, performance, and trustworthiness of trajectory generation.
